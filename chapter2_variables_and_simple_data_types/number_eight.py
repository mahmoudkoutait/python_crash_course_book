# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations 
# in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
# print(5+3)
# Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on 
# each line.
