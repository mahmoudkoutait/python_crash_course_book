# You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is 
# available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
#  • Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or 3-5. Add a print() call to the 
# end of your program, informing people that you found a bigger table.
#  • Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
#  • Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
#  • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
#  • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
